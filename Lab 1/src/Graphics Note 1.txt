quiz on C++ on Jan 31st for Comp Graphics
- Function
- Recursion
- control (if/else, for, while, etc...)

1. nD Space: R^n (typically)
	n: number of dimensions
Examples:
* 1D space: time, along a line or curve
* 2D space: plane, sphere
* 3D space: the world we live in
* 4D space: 3D + time

Cartesian Reference Frame / Cartesian Co-ordinate System
- Cartesian is Orthoganal
- used to compare point from the origin
- Cartesian is flipped for displays
- Equation to fix inversion: y = ymax - yinvert

2. Polar Coordinates
- Coordinate transformation from (r,theta) to (x,y) space:
  x = rcos(theta)
  y = rsin(theta)
  Angle(theta): in radians
- r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
- theta = tan^-1(y/x)

3. Vector:
- "arrow"
- multiple interperation
- has magnitude (length) and direction
- mag = sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2  + (z2 - z1)^2 )
- vector length 2D = |v| = sqrt( Vx^2 + Vy^2 )
- vector length 3D = |v| = sqrt( Vx^2 + Vy^2 + Vz^2)
- has no position
* Notation: V (H&B)
* (Vx, Vy, Vz) (H&B), also (x, y, z)
- Scalar Vector: sV = (sVx, sVy, sVz)

4. DOT Product
- how you multiply
- U * Y = |UY|*cosTheta
- helps find Projection
- P * Q = XaXb + YaYb

5. CROSS Product
- U * Y = |UY|*sinTheta
- area of the parallelogram spanned by a and b ( a * b )
- used to create depth
- a x b = |X  Y  Z |
	  |Xa Ya Za|
	  |Xb Yb Zb|
- Cross Product is the determinate of a matrix
- |YaZb - YbZa|
  |XaZb - XbZa|
  |XaYb - XbYa|
- a x b = A*b is a dual matrix
- Dual Matrix ex:
	|0 -Za Ya|
	|Za 0 -Xa|
	|-Ya Xa 0|

6. Points
- Point: position in nD space
* Notation: P (H&B)
